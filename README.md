This Proyek about hospital bed mechanism which is modelling as fourbar linkage. 
The link consits of fixed link, rotating link, floating link and follower link
Platform matress placing on rotating and following link
To adjust height of bed rotating link and floating link connected with an actuator
for fulfil target of bed position, maximum actuator motor force  for lift the patients, also limitation of motor stroke, the program added with facility bed parameter input
For chosen bed parameter the motion of bed mechanism can be seen from the animation of bed motion
